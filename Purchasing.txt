	Order a set of each of those. You'll need one of each board for each tagger you plan to add a display to.
	OSHPark works in multiples of 3, so you'll be getting a multiple of 3 of each PCB you order.

	Order a set of each of those. You'll need one of these sets for each tagger you plan to add a display to.
	Each of these sets is enough parts for one of the relevant PCBs.

Other things:
	You'll also need cable to go between the two boards.
	http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?x=0&y=0&lang=en&site=us&KeyWords=A1663R-25-ND
	is a 25 foot length of cable that will work, and gives you enough cable to do at least 10 taggers.
	You'll also need ends and a crimp tool, which can be found at your local hardware store.
	You want a 6-position male RJ-11 connector(AKA Ye Olde Phone Cable Connector) and the crimp tool to go with it.
	
	You'll also need a few pieces of jumper wire. Your choice, but black and red are good.
	
	You will most likely need soldering wick (AKA desoldering braid, among other things).
	
	If you don't have a Zilog USB Smart Cable or other Zilog programming device, you will need one.
